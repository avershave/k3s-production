# Moodle Install

This is an addition to the original k3s-production Crucible installation to add Moodle.

After following the previous steps of installing Crucible, you should be able to fully install Moodle by filling out the remainder of the env specific to Moodle and running the `setup-moodle` script. There are more configurations then what are in the env file. To see all of the configurations, please head over to the [Bitnami Helm repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/moodle#parameters).
